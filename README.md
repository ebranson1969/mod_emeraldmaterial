- Emerald Sword
- Emerald Broadsword
- Emerald Bow
- Emerald Helmet

## Installation Requirements
Emerald Material Mod versions 1.8-x.x require Minecraft 1.8 with compatible version
of MinecraftForge installed.

## Installation Instructions
Copy the `mod_emeraldmaterial_forge-1.8-x.x.jar` file to the `mods` directory in your Minecraft
data directory.

## Usage Instructions
All items are crafted with recipies similar to their iron or diamond couterparts, but using
Emeralds as the main material.  Blocks can be crafted with Emerald Blocks using standard recipies,
but they will most often be obtained from the expected tabs in Creative Mode.
